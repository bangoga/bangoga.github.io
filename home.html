                  <p style="color:white;text-align:center;">SoMM’s	mission	is	to provide	education	equality	to	children	at	risk,	to	reduce that	risk	by	providing a	safe	and supporting	environment, and	to achieve	this	education	and	personal	growth	potential through musical	avenues.<br><br>
Individual risk can be defined as financial, academic, or personal circumstances that may	hinder	the	child	from receiving	an	equal	opportunity	for	education.	We	hope to reduce this risk and create a sense of personal empowerment in these children by introducing them to musical technique, exploring music through workshops and group classes, and sharing our passion for music with them.	We	want to allow every child	a	chance	to	learn music for	free. We	want to give them	an	opportunity	to	recognize and utilize alternative	sources	for	learning and take control of their own education. We not only strive to kickstart their musical	development,	we also aim	to foster	and	create	an	environment	in	which	the	student	can grow emotionally and individually.<br><br>
                  The School	of	Music	Montreal	is	a	non-profit	organization	in	the	making in	affiliation	with	McGill	University.</p>
